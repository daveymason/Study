# Study
 A study file for all things Coding.

 It's aways good to refresh yourself on the fundementals, with the online learning explosion in the last decade I've often found myself in "tutorial hell". So I decided to put together a little repo where I can breakdown the fundamentals of code and breakdown the concepts of different things that I study and learn on a daily basis. This should help me build knowledge for interviews and let me stay up to date with using Guithub, while at the same time pushing me to study and keeping my basic skills up to date.
